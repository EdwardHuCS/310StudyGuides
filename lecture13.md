# Lecture 13 Agile Development
__Lecture 13: more depth on agile techniques, characteristics of agile process, xp programming, values, activities, and practices, scrum, watch those videos, know how to diagram out scrum models, know what different documents and ceremonies are__
## Scrum Sprint Cycle
- Product Backlog is a prioritized list of features required by customer
- Sprint Backlog is features to be done this sprint
- Every day, a 15 minute meeting is held. what have you accomplished, what obstacles, and what will be accomplished before next meeting
- At end of sprint, a sprint review will be held and functionality will be demonstrated
## Scrum roles
1. Scrum Master
    - ensures that the team is following scrum practices.
2. Team member
    - Different from other methods, in Scrum a team is not just the executive organ that receives its tasks from the project leader, it rather decides self dependent, which requirements or User Stories it can accomplish in one sprint. It constructs the tasks and is responsible for the permutation of those â€“ the team becomes a manager. 
3. Product owner
    - typically a project's key stakeholder. Part of the product owner responsibilities is to have a vision of what he or she wishes to build, and convey that vision to the scrum team. The agile product owner does this in part through the product backlog, which is a prioritized features list for the product.

## 4 Key Documents
1. Product Backlog
    - list of all things that needs to be done within the project.
2. Sprint Backlog
    - The sprint backlog is a list of tasks identified by the Scrum team to be completed during the Scrum sprint
3. Task Chart
    - Holds the status of the tasks of the sprint from Todo, In Progress, Done
4. Burndown Chart
    - A burn down chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. The outstanding work (or backlog) is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. That is, it is a run chart of outstanding work. It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed.

## XP
Based on Activities, Values, Practices
### Activities
Coding, Testing, Listening, Designing
### Values
Communication, simplicity, feedback, courage
### Practices
- client part of the team
- pair programming
- test driven development
- small releases
- continuous integration
- sustainable pace
### Coding and Tests
- code tests first
- refactor
- acceptance tests developed by customer
- unit tests for all code
- create tests to detect any bug found
